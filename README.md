# tierlist-maker-clone + Doubly Linked Lists!

## ðŸš§ in progress

A basic tierlist-maker clone with vanilla JS and pure HTML/CSS. No frameworks.

## About

Have you ever googled how does a **doubly linked list** works *with a tierlist example* without any luck?

Well, now you will have exactly that! ðŸ¤£

Jokes aside, this is a very simple project that tries to clone how a [tierlist](https://tiermaker.com) works. 
It gives a nice visual of how a doubly linked list can be applied to this and its internal working.

At first, I was convinced that I needed a _doubly linked list_ DS to achieve this so I developed it with the corresponding tests (a nice challenge).
However, the HTML [`Drag and Drop API`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API) provides all whats needed to create a fully functional tierlist. (I will google stuff first... Lesson learnt ðŸ¥²).

So... to take advantage of all that unecessary work I did, I turned it into a more 'educational' project:

A `DoublyLinkedList` data structure is created for every tier with which you can interact with from the your browser's console.
