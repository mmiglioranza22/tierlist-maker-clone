## ðŸš§ in progress

A basic tierlist-maker clone with vanilla JS and pure HTML/CSS. No frameworks.

## About

Have you ever googled how does a **doubly linked list** works with a tierlist without any luck?

Well, now you will have exactly that! ðŸ¤£

Jokes aside, this is a very simple project that tries to clone how a [tierlist](https://tiermaker.com) works. It gives a nice visual of how a doubly linked list can be applied to this and its internal working.

At first, I was convinced that I needed a _doubly linked list_ DS to achieve this so I developed it with the corresponding tests (a nice challenge). However, the HTML [`Drag and Drop API`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API) provides all whats needed to create a fully functional tierlist. Lesson learnt ðŸ¥².

So... to take advantage of all that unecessary work, I turned it into a more 'educational' project. A [DoublyLinkedList] data structure is created for every tier and you can see in real time from the your browser's console.

Tests were made in Mocha (Chai).
